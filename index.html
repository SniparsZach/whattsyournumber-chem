        <p>
            My research question is based on explosives. I am taking a look on 3 different types of explosives, <span id="bold">TNT</span>, <span id="bold">ANFO</span>, and <span id="bold">PENT</span>. I decided to measure how many of a certain atom is
            in 5 US tons of the three different explosives, nitrogen in TNT, hydrogen in ANFO and oxygen in PENT. I first converted US tons to grams, which is 4,538,925 grams to 1 US ton. For ANFO, I had to determine the chemical compound for fuel oil
            and from there determine the 94.3% Ammonium Nitrate and the 5.7% Fuel Oil combination.

            <h3>
                Assumptions
            </h3>
            <p>
                I assumed that the fuel oil would be Diesel Fuel with a chemical compound of 12 Carbon and 23 Hydrogen (average courtesy of Google). These assumptions could possibly affect the accuracy of the calculations because diesel fuel has different chemical formulas
                and the formula I have is averaged.
