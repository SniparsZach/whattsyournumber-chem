                Question 1 - Trinitrotoluene (TNT)
            </h3>
            <h3>
                How Many Nitrogen Atoms are in 5 US Tons of TNT?
            </h3>

        <p>
            The first thing I looked for about TNT was the chemical formula that makes up TNT. After that I had to determine the weight I was going to be measuring about this explosive. Seeing that the heavier the explosive compound, the bigger the blast, I decided
            on 5 US Tons. After I decided on the weight of the explosive I was going to be measuring, I had to convert from US Tons to grams.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Google, <span id="bold">5 US Tons</span> is equivalent to <span id="bold">4,535,925 grams</span> or <span id="bold">907,185 grams</span> per US Ton.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finding out how many grams are in 5 US Tons, I then needed to find the Chemical Formula for TNT and the molar mass. The Chemical Formula for TNT is <span id="bold">[ C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> ]</span> with
            the molar mass being <span id="bold">227.13 grams</span> and the amount of molecules in 1 mole of TnT being <span id="bold">1.26462 * 10<sup>25</sup>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then to create an equation that would get us to figure out how many Nitrogen Atoms are in 5 US Tons of TnT. Since we need to find out how much Nitrogen is in <span id="bold">5 US Tons of TnT</span> , then our equation should equal how many
            Nitrogen atoms are in 5 US Tons of TnT. We also have our beginning measurement which is <span id="bold">5 US Tons</span> because we are trying to find how many Nitrogen atoms are in <span id="bold">5 US Tons</span> . Therefor, our starting
            measurement is <span id="bold">5 US Tons</span> and our ending measurement is going to be the total amount of Nitrogen Atoms in <span id="bold">5 US Tons of TnT.</span> To fill in the difference, our first step from <span id="bold">5 US Tons</span>            is finding how many grams are in 1 US Ton, which is <span id="bold">907,185 grams</span>. After that we grab the molar mass of TNT and compare it to how many moles it is equivalent to. After that, we multiply by how many moles of Nitrogen
            are in 1 mole of TNT. The second to last step of this step is get the amount of atoms in 1 US Ton, since in the beginning of the equation when we started to compare it was 1 US Ton to Moles of TNT. Our final step is to multiply the number
            by 5 to go from 1 US Ton to 5 US Tons.
        </p>
        <p>The final number from this equation is <span id="bold">3.6078906815480122 * 10<sup>28</sup> Nitrogen Atoms</span> or in other words, more than <span id="bold">36 Octillion Nitrogen atoms.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span id="bold">
                The calculations for getting the amount of Nitrogen atoms is as follows:
